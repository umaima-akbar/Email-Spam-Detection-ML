# 📩 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses **Python** and **Logistic Regression** to detect spam emails from real SMS text messages. Built during my internship at [Data Zenix Solutions](https://www.datazenix.site/), this model classifies messages into spam or not spam (ham) based on word patterns and message structure.

## 🧠 What I Did

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed 5,000+ text messages  
✅ Removed stopwords, lowercased, tokenized and vectorized the text  
✅ Built a **Logistic Regression** classifier using TF-IDF  
✅ Achieved **97.6% accuracy** and a strong F1-score!  
✅ Visualized most common spam & ham words

## 🔍 Key Insights

📌 Spam messages often use words like *“win”, “free”, “claim”, “urgent”*  
📌 Ham (normal) messages include casual conversation words like *“okay”, “tomorrow”, “call”*  
📌 Spam messages tend to be longer and more aggressive in tone  
📌 Confusion matrix shows the model performs exceptionally well on both spam and ham
